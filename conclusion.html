	<p id="words">Oysters at Governer’s Island are, on average, significantly larger than East River oysters; the two locations had an over 33 mm difference between their oyster sizes. Oysters at Governer’s Island had a lower mortality rate as we found no dead oysters versus at the East River, where we found two. The data we collected for water quality at the East River and Governor’s Island showed that the East river was generally cleaner and safer; it had a higher dissolved O2 which was 4, being closer to the optimal level of 6.5-8 rather than the East River which had 3 (Government of Northwest Territories, n.d.). The nitrite of Governor’s Island is also relatively high which can be bad for organisms in the water as high amounts of nitrite can cause a condition called methemoglobinemia that can affect the blood’s ability to carry blood. Oysters can clean the nitrite, which contains nitrogen, by filtering like they do to anything else (Michigan Department of Health and & Human Services, n.d.). The rest of the data did not have many differences such as pH, nitrate, coliform bacteria and salinity. This data demonstrates that there are more oysters in the East River which are cleaning it faster than Governor’s Island and perhaps the reason for the oysters' small size and higher death rate, which indicates poorer health than those at governor's island, is connected to the fact that they have cleaned the water better, filtering more pollutants (Ocean's Clean-up, n.d.). This means that oysters, in areas with polluted water, can essentially take the bad health of the water, and thus the ecosystem, and store it in themselves. An error that may have affected our results is an error in the equipment as we did not test the measuring tools before we used them with a known value which could have resulted in inaccurate measurements. This error most likely did not affect our interpretation of the data significantly as the equipment error was most likely only skewed slightly and the differences in water quality between the two locations were significant. The data demonstrates that oysters are able to intake polluted water and clean it resulting in the damage to their own health, creating a healthier ecosystem for not only humans but the thousands of other organisms living in the ocean. Organizations like the Billion Oyster Project, which hopes to increase oyster populations in New York City can be incredibly beneficial as a way to clean up the polluted water created by human waste that directly harms the environment creating a cleaner and happier oceans.
